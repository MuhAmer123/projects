                                    ***Diabetes Management Predictor***

***The Diabetes Management Predictor is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting blood glucose levels to assist in managing diabetes effectively. The project analyzes patient records obtained from various sources, including automatic electronic recording devices and paper records.


***The project focuses on events related to blood glucose measurements, specifically the following codes:

58: Pre-breakfast blood glucose measurement
59: Post-breakfast blood glucose measurement
60: Pre-lunch blood glucose measurement
61: Post-lunch blood glucose measurement
62: Pre-supper blood glucose measurement
63: Post-supper blood glucose measurement
64: Pre-snack blood glucose measurement



***The provided Python code exemplifies a fundamental workflow for leveraging machine learning in predicting blood glucose levels for diabetes management. Initially, the dataset is assumed to be preprocessed and organized in a DataFrame format, containing relevant features and target variables. Subsequently, the dataset undergoes a split into training and testing sets, facilitating model evaluation on unseen data. A linear regression model is selected for its suitability in regression tasks and trained on the training data to establish predictive capabilities. Predictions are then generated on the testing set, enabling assessment of model performance through metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Lower values of these metrics indicate superior predictive accuracy. Moving forward, the trained model can be integrated into various applications, including web or mobile platforms, healthcare systems, or automated pipelines, to provide real-time predictions and support in diabetes management. Continuous monitoring of model performance is essential for ensuring reliability and effectiveness over time, with potential enhancements and updates informed by user feedback and evolving healthcare requirements.
